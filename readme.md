This is a five-finger exercise for AI assistants (aiders) to manipulate code and use local models such as Qwen2-VL & Whisper (Hugging Face Interface) to extract English translations from rather exotic (for me as a non-speaker) video files by checking the Chinese and Indonesian subtitles as well as the Chinese audio track. 

The video files are not part of the repository.
